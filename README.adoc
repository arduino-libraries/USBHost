The USBHost library allows an Arduino Due board to appear as a USB host, enabling it to communicate with peripherals like USB mice, keyboards and HTC Vive trackers (requires at least tracker firmware v.20).

For an USBHost library supporting Vive tracker for Arduino SAMD boards see [here](https://github.com/matzman666/USBHost-samd).
